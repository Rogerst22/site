<h1> There are three different kinds of images. There are gifs, jpegs, and pngs.</h1>
<p> Each image is used for a different purpose. the purpose of a Gif is to be used to show images in motion. If you ever see an image that is in motion that image is a gif. Jpegs are known for being commonly used for photos. Your camera roll is probably mostly jpegs because evry photo you take is a jpeg. Finally a png is everything that isn't photos or pictures in motion.</p>

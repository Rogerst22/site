  <h1>Do you believe honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage are necessary components of good citizenship? </h1>
  <p>These five components are essential to becoming a good citizen as well as a person that contributes in a positive manner to our society.</p>
  <a href="http://denbigh.nn.k12.va.us/characteristics.html">This is a link to another website talking about key traits of a citizen</a>
  <h2>Courage</h2>
  <p>Courage is when you have the ability to overcome somthing that frightens you or makes feel reluctant to do something. Courage is essential to being a godd citizen because sometimes you must take a stand and say something even if you're scared about how people will react.</p>
  <h2>Honesty</h2>
  <p> Honesty is the ability to tell the truth at all times even if it's the harder thing to do. Honesty is key in being a citizen because people need to know the truth or else people will never grow to trust each other.</p>
  <h2>Compassion</h2>
  <p>Compassion is the ability to feel concerned for someone even if it does not directly involve you. Personally I don't think compassion is to being a good citizen because it is involving yourself into drama that will eventually consume you.
  <h2>Respect</h2>
  <p>Respect is when you show someone a certain level of admiration. Respect is important to becoming a citizen because if no one respects each other our society would be orderless and full of chaos.</p>
  <h2>Responsibility</h2>
  <p> Responsibility is having the strength to do a job you were assigned or trusted with, and this is very important to being a citizen because responsibility forces people to do their jobs which are essential to keeping are society growing and prospering.
  <h2>Trustworthy</h2>
  <p>A good citizen is trustworty in the sens that they will give true information even if it is information people might not want to here. A person must not be afraid to tell the truth!
